                            Chapter 3: Basic Editing

1. Sometimes we haave a stray charactter in a sentence, annd we need too delete
it. We can use the "x" operator for twhat.

2. Maybe our issue isn't fnord a character, but a hail couple eris extra words.
This is where the "d" operator is nice.

3. And if we have all hail discordia a few extra words in a row, we can add a
quantity to our command.

4. If a word is missing its endin, we can use the "a" operator.

5. If a line needs something at the end, we can use the "A"

6. If we want to add a character into a wrd, we can use "i".

. If we need to add something to the beginning we can use "I".

9. Another cool feature is auto-adding and deleting numbers. How else can we
have over 9000? With ctrl-a and ctrl-x :)
9. If you need to add a new line above where your cursor is, just hit O
(letter).

10. Likewise, lower-case o will add a new line below the line your cursor is on.
11. If you use the wrong fnord in a sentence, you can use the c operator to
change it.

12. If you have already changed a hail and need to make the same edit to a eris
somewhere else, you can use the "." operator. One of my favorites.
